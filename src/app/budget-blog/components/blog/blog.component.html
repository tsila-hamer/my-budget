	<h1>12 Budgeting Tips to Help You Win With Money</h1>

	<h2><strong>Take Your Budget to the Next Level With These 12 Tips</strong></h2>

	<p><strong>1. Budget every month before the month begins. </strong></p>

	<p>To get ahead, you need to think ahead. This is solid life advice&mdash;and a superb first budgeting tip. You need a new budget each month. And you need to set that up <em>before</em> the month begins.</p>

	<p>With EveryDollar, it&rsquo;s easy. You can copy this month&rsquo;s budget to the next, and then adjust where you need to. Think about the unique spending coming up (like your BFF&rsquo;s birthday or that yodeling competition entry fee) and move money around to make room for it.</p>

	<p><strong>2. Budget to zero.</strong></p>

	<p>Why? Telling all your money where to go means you&rsquo;re in charge of it&mdash;you own it instead of the other way around. Practically speaking, here&rsquo;s how you create a zero-based budget:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Add all sources of income.</li>
		<li>Type in your fixed expenses, like mortgage or rent, utilities, food and transportation.</li>
		<li>Then type in common monthly expenses, such as restaurants, entertainment and clothing. Check your past budgets or bank statements to get an idea of what you typically spend.</li>
		<li>Give every dollar a name, meaning all your income has a place in your budget. If there&rsquo;s still money left after you&rsquo;ve entered all those expenses, put it toward your current money goal, like paying off debt.</li>
	</ul>

	<p><strong>3.&nbsp;Track every expense.</strong></p>

	<p>Seriously. Every. Single. One. The impulse pack of gum. The drive-thru coffee on the way to work. The corgi-covered socks. Those things add up. Literally. $ + $ + $ = $$$. Tracking every expense is how you know where all your money&rsquo;s going. Then you can start telling your money to go exactly where you want.</p>

	<p><strong>4. Review your spending habits.</strong></p>

	<p>You have to get real with yourself. And you do that by reviewing your spending habits. That gum-buying routine, drive-thru coffee habit, or sock obsession could be costing you some serious money that would be way better spent on your current money goal.</p>

	<p>Be honest with yourself about places you overspend. You either need to cut back or think about upping a budget line. But, remember, &nbsp;if you spend more in one spot, you have to spend less in another. It&rsquo;s the circle of budgeting, young Simba.</p>

	<p><strong>5. Set a realistic budget.</strong></p>

	<p>Like we just said, it&rsquo;s okay to add some money into a line if you&rsquo;ve been unrealistic with the planned amount. If you&rsquo;re trying to <a href="https://www.everydollar.com/blog/save-on-groceries">save on groceries</a>, for example, and you&rsquo;ve done all the coupon clipping, meal planning, and BOGO shopping you can&mdash;but you&rsquo;re still overspending each month&mdash;you probably need to up that grocery budget.</p>

	<p>But remember, there&rsquo;s no magic money tree dropping dollar bills into your wallet when you change a planned amount. Like a teeter totter of money, when one budget line goes up, another must go down. Sorry, entertainment line: I need real food more than the mega-size popcorn at the movies.</p>

	<p><strong>6. Make adjustments. </strong></p>

	<p>So, as you see, <a href="https://www.everydollar.com/blog/forgotten-part-of-a-successful-budget">adjustments</a> will and must be made as you budget. Don&rsquo;t freak. Lots of people think a budget is set and can&rsquo;t be adjusted. But no way, friend. No way. This is <em>your </em>money. And <em>you&rsquo;re </em>the boss of it. That&rsquo;s what a budget does. It puts you in charge.</p>

	<p>So we already said you&rsquo;ll need to adjust when you realize you started with unrealistic expectations. You&rsquo;ll also need to adjust when a bill is more or less than what you planned. Moral of the story is: Don&rsquo;t be afraid to make adjustments. Just keep the goal of spending less than you make (overall) a key objective. That&rsquo;s how you succeed with your money.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

	<p><strong>7. Create a &ldquo;Miscellaneous&quot; category.</strong></p>

	<p>We&rsquo;re not elephants. We do forget. Your kid&rsquo;s school fundraiser. Your $2 portion for that co-worker&rsquo;s birthday cake. Your anniversary. (Yeah. Don&rsquo;t forget that.) You might be surprised when these things pop up, but your wallet doesn&rsquo;t have to be. Make room in your budget for the little things that slip your mind by creating a &ldquo;Miscellaneous&rdquo; line with $50 or so in it.</p>

	<p><strong>8. Budget for semi-annual expenses.</strong></p>

	<p>There are some things that really shouldn&rsquo;t be a surprise hit to your budget, though, even though they don&rsquo;t come every month. We&rsquo;re talking about those semi-annual expenses like car insurance, your pet&rsquo;s annual checkup, your anniversary (because&mdash;seriously, you should be ready for this). One perfect option is to set up a <a href="https://www.everydollar.com/blog/how-to-budget-for-big-expenses">sinking fund</a> for any and every semi-annual expense. This way you can be saving up month by month for the day that expense is due.</p>

	<p><strong>9. Save for big purchases a little at a time.</strong></p>

	<p>Another great thing about sinking funds is you can use them to <a href="https://www.everydollar.com/blog/how-to-create-a-fund-to-budget-for-large-expenses">save up for big purchases</a>. Be prepared for new tires by being watchful of the treads on all the wheels. Save up for Christmas all year long since you know it&rsquo;s coming December 25. Pay cash for that new digital camera to take your photography hobby to the next level (or create a new side hustle). You do all these things by setting up sinking funds in <a href="https://www.everydollar.com">EveryDollar</a> and setting aside money each month for that big purchase.</p>

	<p><strong>10. Budget for fun.</strong></p>

	<p>We don&rsquo;t mean to budget <em>for the fun of it</em>&mdash;though we think budgeting with EveryDollar is <em>quite </em>fun. We mean put in a budget line for <a href="https://www.everydollar.com/blog/budget-friendly-fun">fun things</a>. All work and no play make you a dull, angry, frustrated, back-sliding budgeter. Of course, don&rsquo;t go crazy. But there are ways to have fun and even <a href="https://www.everydollar.com/blog/cheap-ways-to-reward-yourself">reward yourself on a budget</a>. And it&rsquo;s easier to stay on track when the track offers one fancy coffee a month, extra foam, hold the guilt.</p>

	<p><strong>11. Understand the difference between needs and wants.</strong></p>

	<p>Speaking of fancy coffee&mdash;we all know that&rsquo;s a want and not a need, right? Yes. We do. But other lines can blur. If your shoes are literally falling apart, you need new shoes. But that red vegan leather moto jacket&mdash;that&rsquo;s a want. We budget for both, but <em>needs</em> get the priority.</p>

	<p><strong>12. Give yourself grace.</strong></p>

	<p>You will make mistakes. We all do. And it generally takes <a href="https://www.everydollar.com/blog/budgeting-what-to-expect">three months</a> before you get the hang of this budgeting thing, so be kind to yourself&mdash;both at the start and throughout your new budgeting lifestyle.</p>

	<p>Because that&rsquo;s what this budgeting stuff is&mdash;a lifestyle. And it&rsquo;s the best kind possible: the <em>life doesn&rsquo;t control my money&mdash;I DO! </em>daily decision to make better money decisions.</p>

	<p>You&rsquo;ve got this. We mean it. You just need a<em> </em>&ldquo;Yeah I can!&rdquo;<em> </em>attitude and a budget.</p>
